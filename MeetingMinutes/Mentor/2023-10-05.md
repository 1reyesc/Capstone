We brought Wyatt up to speed with the data from our first client meeting. Wyatt highlighted the fact that creating an AWS account requires a credit card and stated that we should bring this up with Alicia. We also discussed our first iteration and the difficulty of turning on the camera. We need to ask Alicia in an email to send us the information of the HP camera expert. Wyatt told us that we need to collectively select our IDEs. We not to prioritize getting tools from our client as quickly as possible. We should set up code reviews. We thoroughly went through business requirements, use cases, requirements, architecture, domain model, tech stack, and prototype.
