## Topics Discussed
- We began by discussing that for iteration 1, it would be nice to be able to focus solely on functionality; getting the camera working.
- We discussed that we need to get the email sent to Dr. Mckoy requesting contact information for the HP VR headset expert.
- We also discussed that we all need to individually email Dr. Mckoy for our temporary AWS logins.
- We discussed that we should all probably use visual studio code.
- Note from Wyatt: Get a greater understanding of what each repo handles and which repos specifically we should be working in.
## Things Clarified
We will meet with Wyatt at Thursday (10/26) at 4:00pm to go over our software and documentation that exists at that point in time.
