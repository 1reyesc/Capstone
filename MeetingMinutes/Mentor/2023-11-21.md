## Topics Discussed
We discussed the project showcases as well as our iteration 2 goals. Wyatt asked about Dr. Mckoy's help setting up AWS. We discussed our primary iteration 2 goals being to set up AWS and the webapp. We are using S3 buckets. S3 buckets are similar to Azure data storage. Our video data will likely not work in a relational database. Wyatt advised us that we must get AWS set up and to demosntrate functionality, we must show that video can be found in AWS data storage. Video should be playable in the web app. 
## Things Clarified 
Thursday November 30th at 4pm will be our next mentor meeting.
