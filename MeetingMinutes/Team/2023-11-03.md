## Topics Discussed
We communicated with Dr. Mckoy to figure out a time to meet with her in Indianapolis to utilize the headset. We evaluated that we are just waiting on the physical headset to collect real data to test our face camera code. We coordinated our schedules to effectively carpool on Saturday. We also planned additional meeting times next week. We dived into the Unity code and were able to find where the code talks to the headset and found the code that retrieves the image. We must still figure out how to display the code. 
## Things Clarified
We will meet on Tuesday and Thursday of next week at 4pm. We will meet up at 10am on this Saturday to carpool together and meet Dr. Mckoy at 12pm at one of her offices. 
## Tasks Distributed
All team members will meet on Saturday to utilize the limited time window in which we have the headset. All team members must be present to take advantage of this opportunity. All team members must bring their laptops and be prepared to code and test on site. We will all be meeting at Ryanâ€™s house at 10am on Saturday. Ryan will be driving us down to Indianapolis and back up to Muncie.
