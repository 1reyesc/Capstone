## Topics Discussed
We decided that most if not all of us could meet with Dr.Mckoy on Monday at 11am to present our second iteration software to her. We sent her a follow-up email because she was originally unable to attend our original time slot. We all mob programmed together to advance our progress with the AWS S3 bucket to pave the way for deployment of the web app and backend. 
## Things Clarified
We will meet again on Monday for both a client-partner meeting and team meeting to put together our presentation for our iteration 2 functional software. 
## Tasks Distributed
Tommy will continue to flesh out the CRC cards and work with Ethan on diagramming. Ryan will manage the communication with Dr.Mckoy regarding the integration of PeakMind interns for data analysis. Peter will send the zoom link to Dr. Mckoy regarding our Monday meeting and will continue his work on setting up the AWS S3 bucket. Beethoven will deploy the web app to AWS. Ethan will deploy the backend to AWS. All team members will work on improvements to the webapp.
