## Topics Discussed
We recapped our client meeting with Dr.Mckoy. We collectively agreed that AWS cloud storage of video fies (mp4) is our most important objective for iteration 2. The webapp can be delayed until next semester. Dr. Mckoy's data scientists can assist us if need be. We have identified that there is no visualization in the webapp after the log-in screen. We may be able to split into 2 teams to work on AWS and the webapp seperately. 
## Things Clarified
We will meet again on Thursday November 30th for our next team meeting. We are hoping to meet and further clarify and distribute tasks in class on Tuesday November 28th. 
## Tasks Distributed
All team members have been instructed to update and select tasks from the story board on github to progress into iteration 2. Major work will resume after Thanksgiving Break.
