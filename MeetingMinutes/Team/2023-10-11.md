## Topics Discussed
- We revised our previous team meeting notes that lacked tasks distributed.
- We talked about the topics that we would discuss with Dr. McKoy.
- We broke down that Ryan would present the business requirements, Beethoven would present the use cases, Peter would present the functional requirements, Ethan would present the Domain Model, while Tommy would present the Prototype. We will then make appropriate modifications to our presentation, following Dr. McKoyâ€™s feedback.
## Things Clarified
- We will briefly meet after our client meeting to discuss our presentation.
- We will not meet again this week due to this being mid-terms week.
- We will meet again on Tuesday of next week and this will likely be a doubled-up meeting, first our biweekly mentor meeting and after that, our own team meeting.
## Tasks Distributed
- Tommy will create the foundation for the presentation slides.
- Ryan will email Dr.McKoy with a followup to ensure that she makes our client meeting.
- Beethoven will work on meeting minutes for both meetings today.
- Ethan will convert the google doc to markdown.
- Peter will flesh out the presentation slide details.
