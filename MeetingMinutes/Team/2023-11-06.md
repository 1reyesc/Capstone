## Topics Discussed
We primarily worked on the presentation slides in this meeting. We coordinated our efforts to draft our second iteration features. We discussed the need to rehearse this presentation to aid in a smoother presentation in class. We also discussed the responsibility of each team member to memorize the information that will be discussed on each slide so that we can have a lower word count per slide overall. This should aid in visual clarity and a concise viewer experience. 
## Things Clarified
We will meet over discord on Monday to rehearse our presentation for roughly 30 minutes. 
## Tasks Distributed
Tommy and Peter will finish up the presentation slides.
Ryan will review the presentation slides to ensure that all requirements are met.
Beethoven and Ethan will work on 1st iteration documentation as well as second iteration features.
