## Things Clarified
We are planning to finish the presentation slides for next class and meet up in the library from 4:30pm to 8pm. We will have our mentor meeting at 4pm. We will meet in person in the library to collaborate together. We need to work on our Deployment.md tonight. 
## Progress Made
We completed presentation slides 1-6. We finished implementing the code for the video encoding using the MediaEncoder class. Additionally, we began taking pictures for our step-by-step user.md. We have drafted most of our second iteration features, but we still need to review these carefully in our team meeting later today.
