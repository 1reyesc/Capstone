## Topics Discussed
Clarifications for iteration 2 features. Dr. Mckoy wants the video data uploaded to the AWS cloud. When save is selected, data must be saved locally and to the cloud. AWS is our biggest priority for iteration 2. The web app visualization will be deprioritized and focused on in iteration 3. 

## Things Clarified
We will meet with Dr.Mckoy prior to our December 4th client meeting due date. We will send her our second iteration functional software over email to review.
