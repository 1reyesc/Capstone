## Topics Discussed
- Add a third actor, scientists, who look at percentages and what they mean in terms of emotion response.
- Modify UC1 Program Flow to start with users put on the VR headset.
- For UC2, think about how we can visualize the data differently between data scientists and users.
- For UC3, keep in mind that there are only 8 customized avatars corresponding to emotion.
- UC3 as currently stated may not be possible.
- Potentially create more avatars or work on more of the frontend.
- Change FR3 for a username and password because we are still in beta testing, not commercialization.
