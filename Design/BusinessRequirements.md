# Business Requirements
* BR1. Reduce stress in the workforce 
   * This is Peak Mindâ€™s primary business goal. The company was founded after Dr. Mckoy noticed a problem in workplace turnover and happiness. Peak Mind seeks to address this issue through their core technologies. The company does this using VR and biometric technologies to measure, remediate, and validate stress.
* BR2. Validate that stress reduction techniques are effective
   * Careful analysis of recorded data will allow Peak Mind to determine the effectiveness of stress reduction techniques described in BR5. By comparing biometrics before, during, and after stress reduction stimuli, Peak Mind will be able to look for statistically significant decreases in stress biometrics. Thus, the mathematical analysis of recorded data will validate the proposed effectiveness of the VR treatments.
