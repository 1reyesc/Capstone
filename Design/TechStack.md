# Tech Stack
Note: We plan to carry over most, if not all, of the previous project's tech stack.
## Web App
* React (Link to https://reactjs.org)
   * Peak Mind utilizes React for the portion of their web app that we will be working with. 
* JavaScript (Link to https://www.javascript.com)
   * JavaScript was previously utilized by the last group of students who worked on the Web App because React is a JavaScript framework. 
* AWS (Link to https://aws.amazon.com)
   * Peak Mind’s database operates as a cloud native system in AWS. 
* Docker (Link to https://www.docker.com)
   * Docker will ensure that our code can run on any system. Our team is using a variety of machines with varying operating systems. A docker container will allow us to move the application into the AWS production environment. 
## VR Visualization 
* Unity (Link to https://unity.com)
   * Unity was selected by the previous team for the purpose of connecting to the VR headset. The HP Omnicept SDK is compatible with Unity. 
* HP Omnicept SDK (https://developers.hp.com/omnicept/docs)
   * Peak Mind uses HP Omnicept headsets, so the HP Omnicept SDK will be necessary to generate the visualization of obtained biometric data obtained via the headset. 
* AWS (https://aws.amazon.com)
   * AWS will be necessary to reach Peak Mind’s biometric database and utilize sample data for the purpose of visualization. AWS is a client specified requirement.
